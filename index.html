                <p>My name is Estera. I come from Croatia, but live in the United Kingdom where I 
                work in a dog rescue centre. Dogs have been my passion since I got my first dog 
                Luna. My other passion is painting. I have been painting since I was a little girl 
                following my father’s steps. Therefore, I made an only possible decision and that 
                is to paint dogs. Mostly I enjoy doing abstract paintings of dogs, but I do very much 
                enjoy making realistic ones as well. Hope you like my paintings as much as I liked making them.</p>

                        when they see in the distance the outline of another ship that could save them. There will also be the 
                        one and only <em>“The Mona Lisa”</em> painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 19th century. This portrait is assumed

                        Portrait”</em> painted by Estera. This is an abstract painting of a dog named Luna. Luna was believed to be 
                        the best dogs in the world. With this painting, Estera managed to achieve something that no other painter 
                        did. She captured the greatness and the shine from Luna.
